# Women in Technology - Puerto Rico 
Welcome to the public landing page for the Women in Technology - Puerto Rico Slack group. Our group is a safe, confidential space for women who work in technology to chat and support each other. Please consider joining us whether you are new to the tech industry or you are a long-time practitioner.

Not a programmer? That’s fine! Our group does not exclude people who work in technical writing, software testing and QA, graphic design, user experience, project management, customer support, or other areas that are sometimes invisible in the discourse on women in tech.

# WHO'S INVITED?
You are welcome to join Women in Tech chat if you identify as a woman in any way that’s meaningful to you.
> **Male friends & allies: we appreciate your support, but this space is for us.**
